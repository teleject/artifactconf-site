However, we live in a world where our digital products and services are judged not just how they look, but by what they do and how they behave.

The emergence of mobile and touch devices presents us with both an opportunity to step away from our desks and explore new ways of thinking, creating, and working, as well as the responsibility to cultivate empathy and contextual awareness for the specific needs of mobile users. In this session, we’ll challenge the idea that the laptop or desktop &amp; mouse should be our initial creation tool when designing for touch and through pairing sketching with various tools and apps available on iOS devices, we’ll tap, swipe, and pinch our way to touch prototypes.</p>

                                        <p>As responsive web design continues to evolve, we’re confronted with difficult problems about how to create adaptive interfaces that look and function beautifully across many screen sizes and environments. How do we handle navigation that’s four levels deep? How do we deal with large data tables? How well do modules like lightboxes, tabs, embeddable maps and more translate to various contexts? </p>
                                        <p>This workshop will take a detailed look at the pros, cons and considerations of many emerging responsive patterns, and will explain how to incorporate them meaningfully in your projects.

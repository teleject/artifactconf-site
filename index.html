    <h3>ARTIFACT is a two-day, single-track conference for DESIGNERS who are adapting to the challenge of designing for a MULTI-DEVICE world.</h3>
    
    <p>The inaugural <a href="/austin/">ARTIFACT Conference in Austin</a> was such a rousing success, we’re doing it again, this time on the East Coast in lovely <strong>Providence, RI</strong>.
    Why Providence? Because it is a historical gem and has a great tech scene, design schools, and fabulous restaurants and shops.
    Plus, it’s affordable! <!--<a href="providence.php">We think you’ll like it.</a>--></p>
    <p>ARTIFACT EAST features (nearly) the same amazing line-up of speakers and sessions as Austin, so if you were one of the many who were not able
    to get a ticket to that sold-out event, here’s your chance.</p>

However, we live in a world where our digital products and services are judged not just how they look, but by what they do and how they behave. So a relevant style guide needs to speak to a larger audience, including the UX designer and developer, to create the attribute that all brands should strive for: consistency.</p>

                  <p>When approaching the design of a responsive website, old habits might focus you on sidebars and footer regions for placing content. It's natural to assume the best responsive solutions are to be found in moving those regions around the page as whole units. But that way of thinking could lead you miss the best stuff about responsive design. Let go of the old habits, and discover how focusing on content can drive far superior responsive layouts.</p>

                      <p>Oh, and the "...And Less" part? Responsive design is a huge topic so unfortunately it's impossible to pack everything about it into a
                      single day. But that doesn't mean we can't try, right? Here's what will be covered:</p>
                    <ul> 
                    <li><strong>The ever-shifting landscape</strong> – The web landscape is getting more diverse every single day, and this section will address why responsivewebdesign is becoming increasingly essential
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Approach</strong> – There's more than one way to skin this mobile web cat. We'll look at the various strategies being used to address the zombie apocalypse of devices
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Foundations of Responsive Design</strong> – Responsive web design 101. Fluid grids, flexible media andmedia queries make up the core of responsive web design
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Principles of Adaptive Design</strong> – What beyond layout do we need to concern ourselves with when creating great multi-device web experiences? We'll cover how ubiquity, flexibility, performance, enhancement and future-friendliness are powerful principles for making great adaptive web experiences.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Atomic Design</strong> – Atomic design is a methodology to help you create robust design systems. We'll go over how to break an interface down into its atomic elements, and why that matters for designing for the multi-device Web
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Strategy and Workflow</strong> – Our new reality means that we need to adapt our process and workflow to match. This section will tackle thorny areas like convincing your clients, changing the behavior of your colleagues and designing in the Post-PSD Era.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Responsive Patterns</strong> – Creating adaptive interfaces is challenging, but thankfully the web community is hard at work creating flexible, downright innovative design patterns. We'll look at how to tackle layout, navigation, images, tables and more.

                      <p>For more than a decade and a half designers have used the same tool to make the web that we’ve used to interact with it, namely the mouse.</p>
                        <p>The emergence of mobile and touch devices presents us with both an opportunity to step away from our desks and explore new ways of thinking, creating, and working, as well as responsibility to cultivate empathy and contextual awareness for the specific needs of mobile users.</p>
                        <p>In this workshop, we’ll challenge the idea that the laptop or desktop &amp; mouse should be our primary creation tool when designing for touch and through pairing sketching with various tools and apps available on iOS devices, we’ll tap, swipe, and pinch our way to interactive touch prototypes.</p>

						<p>Are you still writing plain old vanilla CSS? Well, then your life is about to change, my friend.</p>

						<p>Sass is a CSS preprocessor that does everything you ever wanted CSS to do, and then compiles down to regular old CSS for those pesky browsers to consume. Remember how, way back when, linked stylesheets made your life a million times better than using repetitive, inline styles? This is going to feel like that all over again.</p>

						<p>In this workshop, Matt Griffin and Patrick Fulton from Bearded will get you up and running using Sass and Compass. We&#8217;ll start with the very basics and help you incorporate great Sassy benefits like:</p>

						<ul>
						<li>Using variables to update color and size values across your whole site in seconds.</li>
						<li>Creating mixins so you can apply multiple lines of CSS (think: button styles) to elements throughout your project.</li>
						<li>Mastering the joys and pitfalls of nesting your SCSS so it reflects your markup, without getting carried away.</li>
						<li>Discovering the wonders of Compass&#8217; built-in mixins, so you never have to think about browser extensions again.</li>
						<li>Implementing Breakpoint to wrangle your media queries, and provide better fall-backs for old IE.</li>
						<li>Organizing your files into sensible groups of partials that will be imported into your final master CSS file, to save you and your team headaches later.</li>
						</ul>

						<p>So please do join us. By the end of this workshop you&#8217;ll be happier, taller, better-looking, and you&#8217;ll never ever want to go back to plain old CSS again. Or anyway, at least the first and last ones, we promise!</p>
